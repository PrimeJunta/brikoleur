Brikoleur is a tabletop role-playing game by "Creative Workers' Collective
'Alexander Bogdanov,'" which is a pseudonym for Petteri Sulonen. The full
work is hosted at http://www.brikoleur.com/.

This character generator is created for it with the Dojo Toolkit. Until an
official release is announced, consider it a work in progress which will be
updated without notice, also in ways which break back-compatibility.
